          "description": "This market predicts whether there will be a significant military escalation between India and Pakistan before January 1st, 2026.  A significant escalation is defined as a substantial increase in military activity beyond the current understanding reached between the two countries' DGMOs on May 10th, 2025, resulting in a notable rise in casualties or territorial changes. This includes, but is not limited to, large-scale cross-border shelling, air strikes, or ground incursions.  The resolution of this market will be based on verifiable reports from reputable international news organizations and government statements.  Any smaller-scale skirmishes or violations of the ceasefire that do not significantly escalate the conflict will not be considered a resolution of 'yes'.",

The article highlights the strained relationship between the two countries, with former Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid emphasizing the need for Pakistan to address terrorism concerns before meaningful dialogue can occur.

          "description": "This market predicts whether Mobius Token ($MBU) will recover at least half of the value lost due to the exploit on May 11th, 2025, by May 11th, 2026.  The exploit resulted in a loss of approximately $2.15 million.  The resolution will be based on the price of $MBU on May 11th, 2026, compared to its price immediately before the exploit.  Specifically, we will compare the market capitalization before and after the exploit. A 50% recovery means the market cap on May 11th, 2026, must be at least 50% higher than the market cap immediately after the exploit was publicly reported.  Data will be sourced from reputable cryptocurrency tracking websites such as CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.  Note that this market does not account for any potential dilution of the token supply.",

While they ultimately opted against a drastic shift, the article also mentions Coinbase's continued purchase of Bitcoin, adding $153 million worth in Q1 2025.  A 'Yes' outcome implies Coinbase adopts a more bullish Bitcoin strategy, potentially increasing its holdings substantially. A 'No' outcome suggests Coinbase maintains a more conservative approach to Bitcoin investment, or experiences unforeseen circumstances preventing a significant increase in holdings.

The article highlights concerns about centralization and suggests the upgrade might consolidate validators, potentially leading to a reduction in the total number of unique validators. However, it also mentions the possibility of attracting institutional investors, which could increase the number of unique validators.  Resolution will be based on publicly available data tracking the number of unique Ethereum validators before and after the Pectra upgrade, comparing the percentage increase to the 20% threshold.  Data sources will include reputable blockchain explorers and analytics platforms.",

The recent US-UK trade deal, heavily tilted in favor of the US, is seen by some experts as a potential template for a similar agreement with India.  This agreement could involve significant tariff reductions from India on various agricultural and manufactured goods in exchange for potentially less substantial concessions from the US.  The outcome will depend on the success of ongoing negotiations between the two countries and whether they can reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the year's end.

A higher-than-expected increase would signal stronger inflationary pressures than anticipated, potentially influencing Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions and impacting investor sentiment in the stock market and broader economy.

Minor or insignificant agreements will not qualify.  News reports citing unnamed sources will not be sufficient to resolve this market; official confirmation is required. This market will resolve to 'yes' if such an announcement is made, and 'no' otherwise.",

          "description": "This market predicts whether the Indian Rupee (INR) will depreciate against the US Dollar (USD) to a rate below 87 at any point before May 9th, 2026.  The question focuses on the USD/INR exchange rate, a key indicator of India's economic health and its vulnerability to geopolitical events.  Recent sharp declines in the Rupee's value, fueled by escalating tensions between India and Pakistan and a strengthening US dollar, have raised concerns about inflation, foreign investment, and fiscal stability. Economists offer differing opinions on the duration and severity of this depreciation, with some predicting a short-term impact while others warn of a more prolonged decline if the conflict escalates.  Resolution of this market will be based on publicly available data from reputable financial sources such as Bloomberg or the Reserve Bank of India, showing the lowest recorded USD/INR exchange rate during the specified period.",

The recent landmark free trade agreement aims to increase bilateral trade by this amount by 2040, but this market focuses on whether this target will be achieved five years earlier.  Factors to consider include the successful implementation of the agreement, global economic conditions, potential trade disputes, and the overall growth of both economies.  A 'yes' outcome indicates that the target is met ahead of schedule, suggesting strong economic ties and successful trade liberalization. A 'no' outcome suggests challenges in achieving the projected trade increase within the specified timeframe.",

The agreement aims to double bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030, implying substantial growth in the near term.  Investors should consider factors such as the speed of tariff reductions, the effectiveness of non-tariff barrier removal, and the overall economic climate in both India and the UK.

A simple ceasefire or cessation of hostilities does not qualify; the agreement must address the core issues of the Kashmir dispute.  The focus is on a formal, publicly acknowledged agreement, not private negotiations or informal understandings.

The resolution of this market will be based on the official death toll reported by the Somali government or a reputable international organization such as the UN or WHO.

The current enrichment level is significantly higher than what was permitted under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and this is a major point of contention in ongoing indirect talks between Iran and the United States.  A reduction would signal progress in the negotiations and potentially de-escalate tensions in the region.  Conversely, a failure to reduce enrichment would suggest a stalemate or further escalation of the nuclear standoff, potentially leading to increased international sanctions or even military action.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports will be used to verify the enrichment level.  Any reports indicating an enrichment level below 40% before the end date will resolve this market as 'YES'.",

Evidence will include official press releases, verifiable sales data, and independent reviews confirming the use of Factorial's technology. \nA 'NO' outcome will be determined if no such commercially available electric vehicle using Factorial Energy's solid-state battery technology is launched by the end date.  The absence of any public announcements, sales data, or independent verification of Factorial's technology integration in a commercially available vehicle will constitute a 'NO' outcome.  Investors should also consider the possibility of announcements after the end date, which would not affect the resolution of this market.",

          "description": "This prediction market focuses on the outcome of the ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Google (U.S. v. Google).  In August 2024, Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled that Google violated antitrust law by paying companies to make Google the default search engine.  A subsequent hearing concluded in May 2025, where the Department of Justice proposed aggressive remedies, including forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser and share data with competitors. Google countered with proposals for less drastic changes. Judge Mehta is expected to issue a decision by August 2025. \n\nA \"YES\" outcome means that Judge Mehta's ruling explicitly orders Google to divest itself of its Chrome web browser as a direct consequence of the antitrust violation.  This would involve a legally binding order mandating the sale of Chrome to another company. A \"NO\" outcome means that Judge Mehta's ruling does not include an order for Google to sell its Chrome browser, regardless of any other remedies imposed.  This could include alternative remedies such as fines, behavioral changes, or data-sharing mandates, but the sale of Chrome would not be part of the judge's decision. \nInvestors should consider the judge's past rulings, the arguments presented by both sides during the hearing, and any potential appeals processes that could delay or alter the final decision.  The outcome will significantly impact Google's market position and the competitive landscape of the internet search and browser markets.",

A recent court ruling mandated Apple to allow apps to offer promotions and collect payments directly from users, potentially circumventing Apple's 30% commission. This ruling has already led to changes in Kindle and Spotify's in-app functionality.  This market focuses on whether this trend will expand to at least five other significant iPhone apps.  Consider factors such as the legal challenges Apple might pursue, the developers' willingness to adopt alternative payment systems, and the potential impact on user experience and app revenue.\n\nA \"YES\" outcome will be determined if at least five major iPhone apps (excluding Kindle and Spotify) demonstrably offer in-app purchase options outside of Apple's payment system, verifiable through publicly available information such as app updates, press releases, or credible news reports by the end date.  Major apps are defined as those with a significant user base and market recognition.\n\nA \"NO\" outcome will occur if fewer than five major iPhone apps (excluding Kindle and Spotify) implement such alternative payment systems by the end date.  The absence of verifiable evidence of such implementation for at least five apps will constitute a \"NO\" outcome. Investors should consider the potential for legal challenges to slow down the adoption of alternative payment systems and the possibility that developers might choose to maintain the status quo due to concerns about user experience or potential conflicts with Apple.",

          "description": "This market predicts the outcome of the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Meta Platforms.  The case centers around Meta's definition of social networking and whether its actions stifled competition.  The FTC argues that Meta's definition is too narrow, focusing solely on connections between friends and family, thus excluding major competitors like TikTok and YouTube. Meta, conversely, claims that all social media platforms are competitors.  The trial involves testimony from Mark Zuckerberg and other social media executives, examining the evolution of social networking and the competitive landscape.\n\nA \"YES\" outcome means that a court rules in favor of the FTC, finding Meta liable for antitrust violations. This could involve significant fines, structural changes to Meta's business, or other penalties. A \"NO\" outcome means that the court rules in favor of Meta, dismissing the FTC's claims or finding Meta not liable.  This would represent a victory for Meta and potentially solidify its current market position.\nInvestors should consider the legal arguments presented by both sides, the evidence presented during the trial, and the judge's rulings.  The outcome will have significant implications for the future of social media regulation and Meta's business model.

This could include the appeal being rejected, delayed indefinitely, or resulting in a minor reduction in damages that does not meet the 50% threshold.\nInvestors should consider the legal track record of both parties, the strength of NSO Group's arguments on appeal, and the potential for further legal challenges beyond 2025. The outcome will depend on the legal arguments presented, the interpretation of the law by the appeals court, and the overall strength of the evidence presented by both sides.  The timeline for the appeal process is uncertain, adding to the market's inherent uncertainty.",

          "description": "This market predicts whether a major technology company (defined as a company with a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion USD) will publicly acknowledge a significant AI hallucination incident that leads to demonstrable financial harm before December 31, 2025.  A 'significant' incident is defined as one resulting in a publicly reported loss of revenue, significant reputational damage (e.g., widespread negative media coverage and/or significant drop in stock price), or substantial legal action directly attributed to an AI hallucination.  The incident must be publicly acknowledged by the company itself, not just reported by third parties.  The financial harm must be quantifiable and demonstrably linked to the AI hallucination.",

          "description": "This market predicts the outcome of Elon Musk's appeal against the West Lake Hills city council's decision concerning the unauthorized fence and gate at his Texas property.  The city council meeting, originally scheduled for May 14th, was postponed to June 11th at the applicant's request.  The council's decision in this meeting will determine whether Musk can keep the structures.  The article highlights Musk's attempts to keep the matter private, citing his work with the Trump administration as a potential reason for exemption from public records laws, but this attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nA \"YES\" outcome means that Elon Musk successfully appeals the city council's decision and is allowed to keep the fence and gate at his Texas mansion.  This would require a reversal of the Zoning and Planning Commission's decision at the June 11th City Council meeting. \nA \"NO\" outcome means that Elon Musk's appeal is unsuccessful, and the city council upholds the previous decision, requiring the removal of the fence and gate.  Investors should consider the history of similar cases in West Lake Hills, the potential legal arguments Musk's team might present, and the council members' past voting records on similar zoning issues. The outcome will depend on the council's interpretation of the city ordinances and the weight given to Musk's arguments.",

          "description": "This market predicts whether a major social media platform will announce the discontinuation of a widely used AI-generated female voice, similar to the 'Jessie' voice described in the New York Times article.  The article highlights the growing concerns and negative reactions surrounding the use of this type of AI voice, particularly its prevalence on TikTok.  The 'Jessie' voice serves as an example of a potentially controversial AI-generated voice that could face discontinuation due to user backlash or company policy changes.\n\nA 'YES' outcome occurs if a major social media platform (with over 100 million monthly active users) publicly announces the discontinuation or removal of a specific AI-generated female voice from its platform before December 31, 2025.  The announcement must be verifiable through official press releases, blog posts, or statements from the platform itself.\n\nA 'NO' outcome occurs if no such announcement is made by any major social media platform before the end date.  This includes scenarios where the voice remains in use, is modified but not discontinued, or where negative feedback is acknowledged but no action is taken to remove the voice. Investors should consider the potential for public pressure on social media companies to address concerns about AI-generated voices, as well as the companies' own internal policies regarding user experience and content moderation.",
